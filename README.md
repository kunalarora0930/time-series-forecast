# Time  Series Forcasting Using LTSM(Long Short Term Memory)
Time series forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is a popular technique in machine learning, especially for predicting sequential data with temporal dependencies. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for learning patterns in sequences.
